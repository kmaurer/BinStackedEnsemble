# New Cleaner Script for running method comparisons on an example data set:
# - bring in data
# - Standardize the y variable name
# - remove any non-numeric columns

# - organize a set of loops to try all inportant tuning variable settings (rebuild "test_all..." function)
# - Run the comparisons 
# - save the results for time taken to run predictions and accuracy of those predictions
